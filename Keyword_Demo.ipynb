The names and domiciles of other companies in \\r\\nwhich adidas AG (\"Company\") holds at least a one-fifth interest, either directly or indirectly, \\r\\nand the disclosures related to these companies can be found in Appendix 3 to these notes. \\r\\nAccounting policies \\r\\n Acquired intangible fixed assets are recognized at cost and subject to periodic straight-line \\r\\namortization over their expected useful lives.  \\r\\nTangible fixed assets are recognized at (acquisition or production) cost. All recognizable \\r\\ndirect and overhead costs are included in production costs. Items with a finite life are \\r\\ndepreciated/amortized over their expected useful lives. \\r\\nBuildings are subject to straight-line amortization at adidas AG. The estimated useful life of \\r\\nbusiness premises is 50 years maximum and from two to ten years for technical equipment \\r\\nand machinery, other equipment, and operating and office equipment. The refurbishment \\r\\ncosts of buildings comprising the World of Sports headquarters, owned by GEV \\r\\nGrundst\\xc3\\xbccksgesellschaft Herzogenaurach mbH & Co. KG, a company within the adidas AG \\r\\nGroup, are depreciated over 20 years. The buildings located on the \"World of Sports\" \\r\\ngrounds, which are beneficially owned by adidas AG by virtue of a use agreement between \\r\\nthe property owner GEV Grundst\\xc3\\xbccksgesellschaft Herzogenaurach mbH & Co. KG and \\r\\nadidas AG are depreciated over a useful life of 33 years.  \\r\\nChattel assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis. \\r\\nMinor-value assets worth less than EUR 410 are written off in full in the year of their \\r\\nacquisition. \\r\\n    \\r\\n Write-downs to the lower fair value are also recognized if an impairment is anticipated to be \\r\\nother than temporary. \\r\\nLong-term financial assets are recognized at cost. To the extent necessary, write-downs are \\r\\nmade to their lower fair value. If the reasons for the write-down no longer apply, the write-\\r\\ndown is reversed to no higher than the historical cost of the asset. \\r\\nInventories are measured at the lower of cost or market. Manufacturing costs comprise \\r\\ndirect costs that must be capitalized and appropriate portions of overhead costs. Allowances \\r\\nare taken for discernible fashion and technical risks, age structure, and marketability. \\r\\nReceivables and other assets are generally recognized at nominal values. Individual \\r\\nadjustments and allowances for doubtful accounts are taken to cover discernible risks. \\r\\nDerivative financial transactions entered into with banks by Group Treasury (primarily \\r\\nforward currency and currency option transactions) are generally related to underlying \\r\\ntransactions with Group companies. Hedge accounting is applied if there is a direct hedging \\r\\nrelationship between these transactions. The net hedge presentation method is applied. The \\r\\nfair values of the hedges are matched and changes in value from the hedged risk which \\r\\noffset each other are not recognized. Unrealized losses are recognized in profit or loss only \\r\\nif they are not covered by unrealized gains in the hedge accounting. Derivative transactions \\r\\nthat are not recognized using hedge accounting are measured individually at fair value. Any \\r\\nlosses resulting from these transactions are recognized in profit or loss; gains are not \\r\\nrecognized in excess of cost.  \\r\\nDeferred taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the carrying amounts and \\r\\ntax bases for assets, liabilities, prepaid expenses and deferred income. Deferred taxes are \\r\\ncalculated based on the combined income tax rate of adidas AG, which is currently \\r\\n28 %. The \\r\\ncombined income tax rate comprises corporate income tax, municipal trade tax and the \\r\\n\\r\\nsolidarity surcharge. \\r\\nA net tax burden would be recognized on the balance sheet as a deferred tax liability. There \\r\\nis an option to recognize a deferred tax asset under \\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 274 (1) no. 2 HGB\\r\\n in the event of any \\r\\noverall tax benefit granted. In the fiscal year, the Company had a net deferred tax asset, \\r\\nwhich it did not recognize on its balance sheet. \\r\\n    \\r\\n Subscribed capital is recognized at the nominal amount. \\r\\nThe Company exercised its option to maintain the special tax-allowable reserve as permitted \\r\\nupon the first-time adoption of the German Accounting Law Modernization\\r\\n Act \\r\\n(Bilanzrechtsmodernisierungsgesetz\\r\\n, \"BilMoG\"). Accounting policies relating to this reserve \\r\\nand its reversal remain the same as previously. \\r\\nProvisions for pensions are calculated on the basis of actuarial biometric assumptions (2005 \\r\\nG mortality tables by Prof. Dr. Klaus Heubeck) in accordance with the projected unit credit \\r\\nmethod (PUC). The provision amount recognized under the PUC method is defined as the \\r\\nactuarial present value of the pension obligations earned by the employees by the balance \\r\\nsheet date according to the retirement benefit formula and the vested pension amount \\r\\nbased on their service in the past. Expected future wage and pension benefit increases are \\r\\nfactored in to the provision using a 1% to 2% p.a. growth rate. Fluctuation is assumed to \\r\\nrange between 5% and 20%, depending on age. The rate used to discount the pension \\r\\nobligations in accordance with \\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 253 (2) sentence 2 HGB\\r\\n amounts to 4.90% as of December \\r\\n31, 2013 (previous year: 5.06%); this rate was determined and published by the German \\r\\nBundesbank as the average market rate for the past seven fiscal years for an assumed term \\r\\nof 15 years. \\r\\nOther provisions cover all discernible risks and uncertain obligations and are recognized in \\r\\nthe settlement amount dictated by prudent business judgment in order to cover future \\r\\npayment obligations. Future price and cost increases are factored in to the extent that there \\r\\nis sufficient objective evidence that they will occur. Provisions with terms in excess of one \\r\\nyear are discounted at the average market rate for their respective maturity over the past \\r\\n\\r\\nseven years, in accordance with \\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 253 (2) sentence 1 HGB\\r\\n. \\r\\nProvisions for partial and early retirement liabilities, reported under other provisions, are \\r\\ndiscounted at 3.65% as of December 31, 2013 (previous year: 3.98%). This rate was \\r\\ndetermined and published by the German Bundesbank as the average market rate for the \\r\\npast seven fiscal years for a residual term of 3 years. \\r\\nSecurities classified as current assets serve exclusively to satisfy liabilities from partial and \\r\\nearly retirement obligations and are isolated from all other creditors. In accordance with the \\r\\nprovisions of HGB, these assets must be offset against the liabilities for which they serve as \\r\\nhedges. Analogously to the offsetting of assets against liabilities, the associated income \\r\\nfrom securities is offset against interest expenses. The assets to be offset are measured at \\r\\n  \\r\\n fair value as determined by their current exchange or market price. Any difference arising \\r\\nbetween the fair value and historical cost of the assets to be offset is subject to a restriction \\r\\non distribution. \\r\\nThe effect from the annual adjustment of the discount rate applied to the provisions in \\r\\naccordance with \\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 253 (2) HGB\\r\\n is recognized immediately in profit and loss under other \\r\\ninterest and similar income or interest and similar expenses. \\r\\nInternally generated intangible assets are not capitalized. \\r\\nLiabilities are recognized at their settlement amount. \\r\\nRevenues are recognized once the price risk has been transferred to the purchaser. This \\r\\ngenerally occurs upon delivery of the merchandise. \\r\\nLicensing revenues are recognized in accordance with the underlying contractual \\r\\nagreements. Claims and revenues generally arise whenever the licensee generates sales \\r\\nrevenue with adidas products. \\r\\nAssets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are recorded at the mean spot rate \\r\\nas of the respective transaction date. Currency translation losses arising as of the balance \\r\\nsheet date due to the measurement of foreign-denominated assets and liabilities are \\r\\nreported. Currency translation gains from the measurement of current assets and liabilities \\r\\nfalling due within less than one year are recorded in profit or loss in accordance with \\r\\n\\xc2\\xa7 256a \\r\\nHGB\\r\\n. Currency translation gains are reported under \"other operating income\" and currency \\r\\ntranslation losses are reported under \"other operating expenses\".  \\r\\nIncome from profit and loss transfer agreements is recognized if the amount to be \\r\\ntransferred or absorbed can be determined with reasonable certainty, even if the annual \\r\\nfinancial statements of the subsidiary have not yet been adopted. \\r\\nIncome from long-term equity investments is generally recognized during the period in \\r\\nwhich a claim to such income arises and it can be reasonably expected that the amounts due \\r\\nwill be collected. \\r\\n    \\r\\n 1.

Group Treasury uses a netting process to balance out any fund \\r\\nsurpluses or deficits at subsidiaries through adidas AG and settle payments between \\r\\nsubsidiaries. Receivables from affiliated companies include EUR 4,664 thousand in trade \\r\\naccounts receivable. A total of EUR 36 thousand in other receivables from affiliated \\r\\ncompanies was written up and EUR 2,870 thousand was written down. \\r\\nOther assets include mainly VAT receivables from tax authorities, withholding tax \\r\\nreceivables, recognized option premiums, accounts payable with debit balances, and \\r\\nreceivables from credit card institutions.  \\r\\n 6.

The convertible bond carries a 0.25 percent p.a. coupon and may be \\r\\nconverted into shares in the Company. The value of the conversion right was determined to \\r\\nbe EUR 55,891 thousand, which was recorded as a discount under prepaid expenses. The \\r\\ndiscount will be amortized as of the earliest date possible, i.e., as of the June 2017 \\r\\nredemption by bond holders. As of the balance sheet date, the discount amounted to EUR \\r\\n36,861 thousand. Other prepaid expenses comprise mainly advance payments for rent, \\r\\nadvertising, insurance premiums and maintenance. \\r\\n 8. Subscribed capital and capital reserves  \\r\\n The share capital of adidas AG did not change in the year under review compared to \\r\\nDecember 31, 2012. As of the balance sheet date and on February 14, 2014, it totaled EUR \\r\\n209,216,186, divided into 209,216,186 registered no-par value shares (\"registered shares\"), \\r\\nand is fully paid in. \\r\\nEach share grants one vote and carries dividend rights from the year in which it is issued. \\r\\nPursuant to \\xc2\\xa7 71b German Stock Corporation Act (\\r\\nAktiengesetz\\r\\n, \"AktG\"), directly or indirectly \\r\\nheld treasury shares do not carry dividend rights. The Company did not hold any treasury \\r\\nshares on the balance sheet date or on February 14, 2014. \\r\\n    \\r\\n \\r\\nThe issue of a convertible bond issue in March 2012, due 2019, increased the capital \\r\\nreserves by EUR 55,890,558.65. \\r\\nThe table below provides an overview of the changes in equity: \\r\\nChanges in equity\\r\\n EUR thousand\\r\\n  Jan. 1, 2013\\r\\n Dividend\\r\\n Net profit for the \\r\\nyear\\r\\n Dec. 31, 2013\\r\\n Subscribed capital\\r\\n 209,216\\r\\n 0 0 209,216\\r\\n Capital reserves\\r\\n 1,200,966\\r\\n 0 0 1,200,966\\r\\n Revenue reserves\\r\\n 655,128\\r\\n 0 0 655,128\\r\\n Retained earnings\\r\\n 606,495\\r\\n -282,442\\r\\n 100,023\\r\\n 424,076\\r\\n Equity\\r\\n 2,671,805\\r\\n -282,442\\r\\n 100,023\\r\\n 2,489,386\\r\\n  Authorized capital  \\r\\nThe Executive Board of adidas AG did not use the existing authorized capital totaling EUR \\r\\n95,000,000 in the 2013 fiscal year or after the balance sheet date up to February 14, 2014.  \\r\\nThe following discussion of the existing authorized capital does not extend to include the \\r\\nrevocation of Authorized Capital 2009/I, 2010 and 2011 resolved by the Annual General \\r\\nMeeting on May 8, 2013, which also was not utilized up to May 8, 2013. \\r\\nPursuant to Article 4 paragraphs 2, 3, and 4 of the Articles of Association which, as of the \\r\\nbalance sheet date governs the Company\\'s authorized capital, the Executive Board is \\r\\n\\r\\nentitled, subject to Supervisory Board approval, to increase the share capital:  \\r\\n until June 30, 2018 \\r\\n by issuing new shares against cash contributions, once or severally, by up to a maximum \\r\\nof EUR 50,000,000 and, subject to Supervisory Board approval, to exclude fractional shares \\r\\nfrom shareholders\\' subscription rights (Authorized Capital 2013/I); \\r\\n    \\r\\n until June 30, 2016 \\r\\n by issuing new shares against contributions in kind, once or severally, up to a maximum \\r\\nof EUR 25,000,000 and, subject to Supervisory Board approval, to exclude shareholders\\' \\r\\nsubscription rights (Authorized Capital 2013/II); \\r\\n until June 30, 2018 \\r\\n by issuing new shares against cash contributions, once or severally, by up to a maximum \\r\\nof EUR 20,000,000 and, subject to Supervisory Board approval, to exclude shareholders\\' \\r\\nsubscription rights for fractional amounts and when issuing the new shares at an issue price \\r\\nthat is not substantially below the market price of shares of the same class; subscription \\r\\nrights may also be excluded in connection with the listing of the Company\\'s shares on a \\r\\nforeign stock exchange (Authorized Capital 2013/III). The authorization to exclude \\r\\nsubscription rights pursuant to the last sentence, may, however, only be used to the extent \\r\\nthat the pro rata amount of the new shares in the share capital together with the pro rata \\r\\namount of other shares in the share capital which were issued by the Company after May 8, \\r\\n2013, subject to the exclusion of subscription rights pursuant to \\xc2\\xa7 186 (3) sentence 4 AktG on \\r\\nthe basis of an authorized capital or following a repurchase, or for which conversion or \\r\\nsubscription rights or conversion or subscription obligations were granted after May 8, 2013, \\r\\nthrough issuance of bonds with warrants and/or convertible bonds, with subscription rights \\r\\nexcluded pursuant to \\xc2\\xa7 186 (3) sentence 4 AktG, does not exceed 10% of the share capital \\r\\nexisting on the date of entry of this authorization into the commercial register or \\r\\n if this \\r\\namount is lower \\r\\n as at the respective date on which the authorization is used. \\r\\n Contingent capital  \\r\\nThe following discussion of contingent capital relates to Article 4 (5) of the Company\\'s \\r\\nArticles of Association and the underlying resolutions of the Annual General Meeting on May \\r\\n6, 2010. There is no other contingent capital.  \\r\\nAs of the balance sheet date, the share capital is conditionally increased by up to EUR \\r\\n36,000,000, divided into up to 36,000,000 registered shares (Contingent Capital 2010). The \\r\\n  \\r\\n conditional capital increase will only be implemented to the extent that the holders/creditors \\r\\nof warrants and conversion rights and/or the persons obligated to exercise the warrant or \\r\\nconversion feature from bonds with warrants or convertible bonds issued or guaranteed by \\r\\nthe Company or a subordinate Group company prior to May 5, 2015 pursuant to the \\r\\nauthorization of the Executive Board by shareholder resolution dated May 6, 2010 exercise \\r\\ntheir warrant or conversion rights or, if they are obligated to exercise the warrant or \\r\\nconversion feature, fulfill their obligation to exercise the warrant or conversion feature or, if \\r\\nthe Company avails itself an option to substitute payment of the monetary amount falling \\r\\ndue, in part or in whole, by delivering shares in the Company, to the extent no cash \\r\\nsettlement is granted, or own shares or the shares of another listed company may be used \\r\\nto service the obligation.

Further transfers are made to a \\r\\npension trust fund to cover the pension entitlements earned by active members of the \\r\\nExecutive Board since 2006. These transfers are recognized in profit or loss. \\r\\nThe provisions for former members of the Executive Board and their survivors amounted to \\r\\nEUR 36,545 thousand as of December 31, 2013 (previous year: EUR 36,839 thousand). \\r\\nAdditionally, there are EUR 6,099 thousand in indirect obligations (previous year: EUR \\r\\n6,193 \\r\\nthousand) for which no provisions have been recognized, since these obligations are fully \\r\\n\\r\\nfunded by the pension fund. As of the balance sheet date, there are no shortfalls for the \\r\\nindirect obligations. Former members of the Executive Board and their survivors received a \\r\\ntotal of EUR 3,421 thousand in retirement pay in fiscal year 2013 (previous year: EUR 3,336 \\r\\nthousand). \\r\\nThe largest item in other provisions concerns provisions for personnel of EUR 90,\\r\\n799 thousand (previous year: EUR \\r\\n87,716 thousand). This amount is primarily attributable to \\r\\nprovisions for performance-based remuneration components. Additional significant items in \\r\\n  \\r\\n other provisions are provisions for outstanding invoices at EUR 44,542 thousand (previous \\r\\nyear: EUR 41,427 thousand) and provisions for marketing of EUR 41,463 thousand (previous \\r\\nyear: EUR 34,226 thousand).  \\r\\nProvisions for early and partial retirement obligations were reported under other provisions \\r\\nat a settlement amount of EUR 6,771 thousand as of December 31, 2013 (previous year: EUR \\r\\n9,620 thousand).

Since a major portion of the \\r\\nproduct costs concerns raw materials that the suppliers have to acquire in US dollars (USD), \\r\\nbillings to the adidas Group are also made in USD. In contrast, sales by Group companies to \\r\\ncustomers are mainly in euros (EUR), pounds Sterling (GBP), Japanese yen (JPY), and in \\r\\nmany other currencies. Currency hedges are entered into to reduce the risk of changes in \\r\\nfair value and in cash flows (currency risks). Most subsidiaries hedge their currency risks \\r\\nthrough adidas AG, except for those subsidiaries that are unable to hedge through adidas AG \\r\\ndue to local currency restrictions, or for whom it is more sensible to hedge locally for \\r\\neconomic reasons. Currency risks that are assumed by adidas AG from subsidiaries by \\r\\nentering into inter-Group currency transactions are strategically hedged with banks, \\r\\nnormally for a period of between 12 and 24 months, using forward exchange transactions, \\r\\ncurrency swaps, currency options, or a combination of currency options, which provide \\r\\nprotection and, at the same time, the opportunity to profit from future beneficial foreign \\r\\nexchange rate movements on financial markets.

The maintenance of the \\r\\nbooks and records and the preparation of the annual financial statements and management \\r\\nreport in accordance with German commercial law are the responsibility of the Company\\xe2\\x84\\xa2s \\r\\nExecutive Board. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the annual financial \\r\\nstatements, together with the bookkeeping system, and the management report based on \\r\\nour audit.\\r\\n We conducted our audit of the annual financial statements in accordance with \\xc2\\xa7\\r\\n 317 HGB \\r\\nand German generally accepted standards for the audit of financial statements promulgated \\r\\nby the Institut der Wirtschaftspr\\xc3\\xbcfer (Institute of Public Auditors in Germany, \\xe2\\x80\\x94IDW\\xef\\xac\\x82). Those \\r\\nstandards require that we plan and p\\r\\nerform the audit such that misstatements materially \\r\\naffecting the presentation of the assets and liabilities, financial position and profit or loss in \\r\\n\\r\\nthe annual financial statements in accordance with German principles of proper accounting \\r\\nand in the management report are detected with reasonable assurance. Knowledge of the \\r\\nbusiness activities and the economic and legal environment of the Company and evaluations \\r\\nof possible misstatements are taken into account in the determination of audit procedures. \\r\\nThe \\r\\neffectiveness of the accounting\\r\\n-related internal control system and the evidence \\r\\nsupporting the disclosures in the books and records, the annual financial statements and \\r\\n\\r\\nthe management report are examined primarily on a test basis within the framework of t\\r\\nhe audit. The audit includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates \\r\\n\\r\\nmade by the Executive Board, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the annual \\r\\nfinancial statements and management report. We believe that our audit provides a \\r\\nreasonable basis for our opinion.\\r\\n Our audit has not led to any reservations.\\r\\n   In our opinion, based on the findings of our audit, the annual financial statements comply \\r\\nwith the statutory regulations and give a true and fair view of the assets,\\r\\n liabilities, financial \\r\\nposition, and profit or loss of adidas\\r\\n AG in accordance with German principles of proper \\r\\naccounting. The management report is consistent with the annual financial statements, and \\r\\non the whole, provides a suitable understanding of th\\r\\ne Company\\xe2\\x84\\xa2s position and suitably \\r\\npresents the risks and opportunities of future development.\\r\\n   Munich, February 14, 2014\\r\\n  KPMG\\r\\n AG Wirtschaftspr\\xc3\\xbcfungsgesellschaft\\r\\n    [original German version signed by:]  \\r\\n  Braun\\r\\n Wirtschaftspr\\xc3\\xbcfer\\r\\n [German \\r\\nPublic Auditor]\\r\\n Wolper\\r\\n Wirtschaftspr\\xc3\\xbcfer\\r\\n [German Public Auditor]\\r\\n   Responsibility Statement\\r\\n  To the best of our knowledge, and in accordance with the applicable reporting principles, the \\r\\nannual financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial \\r\\nposition and profit or loss of the company,\\r\\n and the Management Report, which has been \\r\\ncombined with the Group Management Report, includes a fair review of the development and \\r\\n\\r\\nperformance of the business and the position of the company, together with a description of \\r\\nthe material opportunities and risks associated with the expected development of the \\r\\ncompany.\\r\\n  \\r\\n Herzogenaurach, February \\r\\n14, 20\\r\\n14 \\r\\n \\r\\nThe Executive Board\\r\\n Supervisory Board Report\\r\\n  IGOR LANDAU\\r\\n Chairman of the Supervisory Board\\r\\n  Dear Shareholders,\\r\\n We look back on 2013 as a \\r\\nchallenging but also \\r\\nsuccessful year. Thanks to strong brands \\r\\nand \\r\\npartnerships in \\r\\nthe world of \\r\\nsport\\r\\ns, a\\r\\ns well as\\r\\n first\\r\\n-class innovations, the adidas Group \\r\\nwas again able to achieve\\r\\n good overall business results. Growth in the emerging markets as \\r\\nwell as the strong \\r\\ngross margin \\r\\nimprove\\r\\nment\\r\\n were key highlights\\r\\n. \\r\\nHowever, t\\r\\nhe Group also \\r\\nfaced \\r\\nsignificant \\r\\nheadwinds in 2013\\r\\n. \\r\\nThe\\r\\n significant\\r\\n negative currency \\r\\ntranslation \\r\\neffects\\r\\n, \\r\\na weak development in Western Europe\\r\\n, \\r\\ngenerally \\r\\nlower demand in \\r\\nthe golf market \\r\\nas well as \\r\\ndistribution issues in Russia/CIS were \\r\\nparticular \\r\\nchallenges. Nevertheless, these issues \\r\\nhave been proactively and resolutely managed, and the Group is well positioned to again \\r\\nachieve sales growth at all brands, in all regions and in all markets as well as to improve \\r\\nprofitability in 2014.\\r\\n  Supervision and advice in dialogue with the Executive Board\\r\\n In the year under review, we again performed all our tasks laid down by law, the Articles of \\r\\nAssociation and the Rules of Procedure \\r\\ncarefully \\r\\nand conscientiously. We regularly advised \\r\\nthe Executive Board on th\\r\\ne management of the company and \\r\\ndiligently\\r\\n and continuously \\r\\nsupervised its management activities, assuring ourselves of the legality, expediency and \\r\\nregularity thereof.\\r\\n  \\r\\nThe Executive Board involved us directly in all of the Group\\xe2\\x84\\xa2s fundamental decisions. \\r\\nAfter \\r\\nin-depth consultation and examination of the detailed information submitted to us by the \\r\\nExecutive Board, we approved individual transactions where required by law.\\r\\n  The Executive Board informed us extensively and in a timely manner through written a\\r\\nnd \\r\\noral reports at our Supervisory Board meetings. This information covered all relevant \\r\\n\\r\\naspects of the Group\\xe2\\x84\\xa2s business strategy and business planning, including finance, \\r\\ninvestment and personnel planning, the course of business and the Group\\xe2\\x84\\xa2s financial \\r\\nposition and profitability. We were also kept up to date on matters relating to the risk \\r\\nsituation, risk management and compliance as well as all major decisions and business \\r\\ntransactions.\\r\\n The Executive Board explained immediately and in a detailed manner any deviations in \\r\\n\\r\\nbusiness performance from the established plans, and we discussed these matters in depth \\r\\nwithin the Supervisory Board.\\r\\n  \\r\\nThe Executive Board regularly provided us with detailed reports for the preparation of our \\r\\nmeetings. We thus always ha\\r\\nd the opportunity to critically analyse the Executive Board\\'s \\r\\nreports and resolution proposals within the committees and within the Supervisory Board as \\r\\n\\r\\na whole and to put forward any suggestions we might have before resolving upon the \\r\\nExecutive Board\\xe2\\x84\\xa2s proposals after in\\r\\n-depth examination and consultation. In the periods \\r\\nbetween our meetings, the Executive Board kept us continuously informed about the current \\r\\n\\r\\nbusiness situation by means of monthly reports.\\r\\n  \\r\\nIn addition to five regular meetings of the Supervisory Board, we held two extraordinary \\r\\nmeetings in the year under review\\r\\n. \\r\\nIn January 2014, an extraordinary Supervisory Board \\r\\nmeeting relating to Executive Board matters took place by way of a conferenc\\r\\ne ca\\r\\nll. Two of \\r\\nthe shareholder\\r\\n representatives were unable to participate in person due to the short notice. \\r\\nThe regular meeting of the entire Supervisory Board which took place in February 2014 dealt \\r\\n\\r\\nwith matters relating to the 2013 financial year. \\r\\n  \\r\\nApart f\\r\\nrom one regular meeting, which two members were prevented from attending due to \\r\\nother business appointments that could not be postponed, all Supervisory Board members \\r\\n\\r\\nattended all \\r\\nregular \\r\\nmeetings in the year under review. The average attendance rate at \\r\\nmeetings of the entire Supervisory Board was therefore just \\r\\nunder 97%. All\\r\\n the committee \\r\\nmeetings, with the exception of one meeting of the Audit Committee and \\r\\nof \\r\\nthe General \\r\\nCommittee, were fully attended. The external auditor, KPMG AG \\r\\n\\r\\nWirtschaftspr\\xc3\\xbcfungsge\\r\\nsellschaft (KPMG), attended all regular meetings of the Supervisory \\r\\nBoard, inasfar as they\\r\\n did not deal with Executive Board matters. KPMG also attended all \\r\\nmeetings of the Audit Committee. The employee representatives held separate meetings to \\r\\nprepare \\r\\nand\\r\\n discuss \\r\\nagenda items for the meetings of the entire Supervisory Board.\\r\\n  \\r\\nIn the periods between meetings, the Supervisory Board Chairman and the Audit Committee \\r\\nChairman maintained regular contact with the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief \\r\\nFinancial Of\\r\\nficer with respect to matters such as corporate strategy, business development \\r\\nand planning, the risk situation and risk management as well as compliance. In addition, the \\r\\nSupervisory Board Chairman was immediately informed about any \\r\\nsignificant\\r\\n events of \\r\\nfundamental importance for evaluating the situation and development of the company and \\r\\n\\r\\nmanagement activities.\\r\\n  Topics for the entire Supervisory Board \\r\\n Our\\r\\n consultations and examinations focused on the following topics:\\r\\n  Situation and business development\\r\\n The development of sales and earnings, the employment situation as well as the financial \\r\\nposition of the Group and the business development of the \\r\\nGroup\\xe2\\x84\\xa2s \\r\\nsegments and individual \\r\\nregions were presented to us in detail by the Executive Board \\r\\nfollowing the close of the \\r\\n\\r\\nrespective quarter and were discussed \\r\\nregularly. Further ongoing topics for discussion were\\r\\n the possible impact of global economic developments \\r\\nand \\r\\nnegative currency translation \\r\\neffects as well as the development of individual br\\r\\nands. \\r\\n  In March 2013, we reviewed and dealt intensively with the KPMG\\r\\n-certified\\r\\n 2012 annual \\r\\nfinancial statements and consolidated financial statements, including the combined \\r\\n\\r\\nmanagement report for adidas AG and the Group, as well as the Executive Board\\'s proposal \\r\\nregarding the appropriation of retained earnings. In May, the Executive\\r\\n Board reported to us \\r\\nin detail about the measures initiated in connection with clearing up the compliance case \\r\\nthat had arisen at Reebok India Company. In addition, the Executive Board provided us with \\r\\ninformation on business development and planned marke\\r\\nting activities in the football \\r\\ncategory in the run\\r\\n-up to the 2014 World Cup\\r\\n. \\r\\nIn August, we dealt intensively with the \\r\\nGroup\\'s new logistics and warehousing strategy and \\r\\nthe\\r\\n possible financial \\r\\nconsequences\\r\\n. At \\r\\nour extraordinary meeting in September, the Ex\\r\\necutive Board informed us that, due to \\r\\nrecent negative market developments, the published sales and earnings targets for the year \\r\\nunder review were no longer achievable.\\r\\n We discussed the reasons in detail, including the \\r\\nrecent intensification of negative currency effects, the continued softness in the global golf \\r\\n\\r\\nmarket and the unexpected short\\r\\n-term distribution constraint\\r\\ns \\r\\nas a result of the transition \\r\\nto a new distribution facility in Russia. \\r\\nIn November,\\r\\n we were provided with \\r\\ndetailed \\r\\ninformation about the competition situation in the sporting goods market.\\r\\n Transactions requiring Supervisory Board approval\\r\\n In accordance with statutory regulations and the Rules of Procedure of the Supervisory \\r\\nBoard, certain transactions and measures require a formal resol\\r\\nution or the prior approval \\r\\nof the Supervisory Board.\\r\\n  In the context of this requirement, at our meeting in February\\r\\n, \\r\\nwe discussed in detail and \\r\\napproved the budget and investment planning for 2013 presented by the Executive Board, \\r\\n\\r\\nwhich, in view of the macroeconomic environment, we deemed to be ambitious. Additionally, \\r\\nfollowing completion of the project, we approved the dissolution of the \"Apple\" committee, \\r\\nwhich had been established ad hoc related to\\r\\n the acquisition of Adams Golf, Inc., USA in \\r\\n2012. At our meeting in March, we discussed and resolved upon the resolutions to be \\r\\n\\r\\nproposed to the 2013 Annual General Meeting, including the proposal regarding the \\r\\nappropriation of retained earnings for the 20\\r\\n12 financial year. \\r\\nAt an extraordinary meeting\\r\\n in \\r\\nJune,\\r\\n held by way of\\r\\n a conference call, the Executive Board provided us with detailed \\r\\ninformation on key strategic distribution centres leased by Group companies on a long\\r\\n-term \\r\\nbasis \\r\\nand the possible purcha\\r\\nse thereof \\r\\nin the interest of optimising profitability\\r\\n. W\\r\\ne specifically dealt with the Executive Board\\'s proposal to purchase the \\r\\nstrategic\\r\\nally \\r\\nimportant\\r\\n distribution centre in Manchester, UK, \\r\\nhitherto\\r\\n leased \\r\\nby a Group company\\r\\n. At our \\r\\nAugust meeting, \\r\\nfoll\\r\\nowing the Executive Board\\xe2\\x84\\xa2s detailed presentation on the future logistics \\r\\nand warehousing strategy for the adidas Group, we resolved \\r\\nto invest\\r\\n in the distribution \\r\\ncentre in Brazil. Additionally, \\r\\nwe dealt with the various possibilities for funding pension \\r\\nobligations of adidas AG and approved funding in the form of a pension trust fund. \\r\\n  Composition of the Executive Board\\r\\n In the year under review and at the beginning of 2014, we took important dec\\r\\nisions \\r\\nconcerning changes on the Executive Board.\\r\\n At our meeting in May 2013, we resolved to \\r\\nextend Erich \\r\\nStamminger\\'s Executive Board mandate by a further three years, taking due \\r\\naccount of his excellent performance and successes in Global \\r\\nBrands\\r\\n. \\r\\nFurthermore, after \\r\\nextensive consultation, \\r\\nwe approved the changes in the terms of his Executive Board service \\r\\ncontract, \\r\\nfollowing the General Committee\\'s proposal. At our Supervisory Board meeting in \\r\\nSeptember, \\r\\nheld by way of a conference call,\\r\\n we \\r\\nextensi\\r\\nvely \\r\\ndiscussed and resolved upon \\r\\nthe appointment of \\r\\nRoland \\r\\nAuschel to the Executive Board with responsibility for Global \\r\\nSales, effective October 1, 2013, and we established his compensation, \\r\\nfollowing the General \\r\\nCommittee\\'s proposal\\r\\n. \\r\\nRoland\\r\\n Auschel has h\\r\\neld various management positions with\\r\\nin the \\r\\nGroup in Germany and abroad in the past 20 years. With the creation of a \\r\\nseparate \\r\\nExecutive \\r\\nBoard function\\r\\n for Global Sale\\r\\ns, we have taken into account the importance of \\r\\nGlobal Sales\\r\\n for our company. At our extraordinary meeting on January 8, 2014, after due consideration \\r\\nwithin the Supervisory Board as a whole, we complied with the request of our long\\r\\n-standing \\r\\nExecutive Board member Erich\\r\\n Stamminger\\r\\n to release him from his duties as Executive \\r\\nBoard member effective March 5, 2014. We approved the termination of his appointment by \\r\\nmutual consent and, following in\\r\\n-depth consultation, resolved upon the appointment of \\r\\nEric \\r\\nLiedtke as member of the Executive Board with responsibility for Global Brands. \\r\\nEric\\r\\n Liedtke \\r\\nhas held various management positions within the \\r\\nadidas \\r\\nGroup both in and outside \\r\\nGermany in the past \\r\\n20 years. At the same time, we determined his compensation and \\r\\napproved the termination agreement regarding the Executive Board service contract \\r\\nwith \\r\\nErich\\r\\n Stamminger, following the General Committee\\'s proposal.\\r\\n  \\r\\n Executive Board compensation\\r\\n Key topics of our meeting as well as of our circular resolution in February 2013 were the \\r\\ndetermination of the Performance Bonuses to be granted to our Execut\\r\\nive Board members \\r\\nfor 2012 and the redetermination of the already paid Performance Bonuses for the 2011 \\r\\n\\r\\nfinancial year and \\r\\nthe \\r\\nprevious years, \\r\\nas proposed by the General Committee\\r\\n. This \\r\\nreassessment was necessary as the financial figures relevant for determining the degree of \\r\\n\\r\\ntarget achievement of our Executive Board members in 2011 and prior years had to be \\r\\nadjusted as a result of the financial irregularities that had arisen at Reebok India Company, \\r\\nwhich had also led to a restatement of the consolidated financial statements for 2011 and \\r\\nprior years.\\r\\n While the restatement of the financial figures necessitated redetermination of \\r\\nthe Performance Bonuses for the 2011 financial year and prior years, resulting in obligations \\r\\n\\r\\nfor repayment by the Executive Board, the already paid LTIP Bonuses 2009/2011 were not \\r\\naffected. \\r\\n  \\r\\nIn March 2013, following in\\r\\n-depth \\r\\nconsideration\\r\\n, we resolved upon the key performance \\r\\ncriteria for granting the 2013 Performance Bonuses, together with the individual short\\r\\n-term \\r\\ntargets, an\\r\\nd determined the Performance Bonus target amount relevant for each Executive \\r\\nBoard \\r\\nmember \\r\\nas proposed by the General Committee\\r\\n. \\r\\nIn February 2014, we discussed the \\r\\nperformance of the Executive Board members in the year under review and resolved upon \\r\\nthe Per\\r\\nformance Bonuses to be granted to them.\\r\\n  Further information on compensation for the 2013 financial year can be found in the \\r\\nCompensation Report\\r\\n SEE COMPENSATION REP\\r\\nORT, P. \\r\\n53. \\r\\n Corporate governance\\r\\n The Supervisory Board regularly monitors the application and further development of the \\r\\ncorporate governance regulations within the company, in particular the implementation of \\r\\nthe recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code (the \\xef\\xac\\x81Code\\xef\\xac\\x82). In ad\\r\\ndition to \\r\\nour February meetings, at which corporate governance is usually the focal point, we dealt \\r\\nin \\r\\n\\r\\nour August meeting \\r\\nwith the amendments to the Code \\r\\nthat\\r\\n were adopted by the Government \\r\\nCommission on the German Corporate Governance Code on May 1\\r\\n3, 201\\r\\n3, essentially \\r\\nconcerning the subject \\xef\\xac\\x81Executive Board compensation\\xef\\xac\\x82. At this meeting, as well as at our \\r\\nmeeting in February 2014, we extensively discussed the recommendation to introduce caps \\r\\nfor the variable compensation components and resolved upon caps accordingly. At the \\r\\nFebruary meeting, we also dealt extensively with the Code\\xe2\\x84\\xa2s recommendation that\\r\\n, when \\r\\ndetermining\\r\\n Executive Board compensation\\r\\n, consideration\\r\\n should be \\r\\ngiven to\\r\\n the relation \\r\\nbetween Executive Board compensation and that of top\\r\\n-level \\r\\nmanagement and of employees \\r\\noverall\\r\\n including\\r\\n development of the compensation\\r\\n over time. \\r\\nWe discussed in detail how \\r\\nto \\r\\ndefine the respective \\r\\nbenchmark \\r\\ngroups for the purpose of these comparisons\\r\\n, and then \\r\\npassed a resolution accordingly.\\r\\n At this meeting, \\r\\nafter comprehensive discussion,\\r\\n we also \\r\\nresolved upon the 201\\r\\n4 \\r\\nDeclaration of Compliance. The Declaration of Compliance w\\r\\nas made permanently available to shareholders on the corporate website at:\\r\\n WWW.ADIDAS\\r\\n-GROUP.COM/CORPORATE_\\r\\nGOVERNANCE\\r\\n. \\r\\n \\r\\nThere was no indication of any conflicts of interest on the part of the members of the \\r\\nExecutive and Supervisory Boards which would require immediate disclosure to the \\r\\nSupervisory Board and would also require reporting to the Annual General Meeting.\\r\\n  \\r\\nThere are no direct advisory or other service relationships between the company and a \\r\\nmember of the Supervisory Board. \\r\\n  Further information on corporate governance at the adidas Group can be found in the \\r\\nCorporate Governance Report including the Declaration on Corporate Governance\\r\\n SEE \\r\\nCORPORATE GOVERNANCE\\r\\n REPORT INCLUDING THE\\r\\n DECLARATION ON CORPO\\r\\nRATE GOVERNANCE, \\r\\nP. \\r\\n48.  Efficient committee work\\r\\n In order to perform our tasks in an efficient manner, we have five Supervisory Board \\r\\nstanding committees\\r\\n SEE SUPERVISORY BOAR\\r\\nD, P. \\r\\n40 and also two project\\r\\n-related ad hoc \\r\\ncommittees, which were established in 2009 and 2012. These committees prepare \\r\\n\\r\\nresolutions of the Supervisory Board as well as topics for Supervisory Board meetings. In \\r\\nappropriate cases, and \\r\\nwithin the legally permissible framework, we have delegated the \\r\\nSupervisory Board\\xe2\\x84\\xa2s authority to pass resolutions to individual committees. With the \\r\\nexception of the Audit Committee,\\r\\n the Supervisory Board Chairman also chairs all the \\r\\nstanding committees. The committee chairpersons inform the Supervisory Board about the \\r\\n\\r\\ncontent and results of the committee meetings at the subsequent meeting of the entire \\r\\nSupervisory Board. \\r\\n  - The \\r\\nSteering Committee\\r\\n did not meet in the year under review. \\r\\n  \\xc5\\x92 The \\r\\nGeneral \\r\\nCommittee\\r\\n held six meetings in 2013, two of them by way of a conference \\r\\ncall. An additional meeting, dealing with topics relating to the year under review, took \\r\\n\\r\\nplace in February 2014.\\r\\n  The main focus of the meetings of the General Committee was the preparation of the \\r\\nresolutions of the Supervisory Board as a whole relating to the Executive Board \\r\\nmembers\\' compensation as explained in detail above \\r\\n\\xc5\\x92 in particular with regard to \\r\\nthe \\r\\nconcret\\r\\ne assessment of the Executive Board members\\' variable compensation \\r\\n\\xc5\\x92 as well \\r\\nas resolutions relating to personnel changes on the Executive Board.\\r\\n At its meeting in \\r\\nFebruary\\r\\n 2013, the General Committee thoroughly discussed a resolution proposal for \\r\\nthe Supervisory Board concerning the amount of the Performance Bonuses to be repaid \\r\\nby the Executive Board members for the 2011 financial year and previous years\\r\\n. It also\\r\\n assessed the individual degree of target achievement with respect to the Performance \\r\\n\\r\\nBonuses \\r\\nto be paid to the Executive Board \\r\\nmembers \\r\\nfor the 2012 financial year\\r\\n and \\r\\nresolved upon a corresponding recommendation to the Supervisory Board\\r\\n. Additionally\\r\\n, \\r\\nin March \\r\\nit discussed\\r\\n the \\r\\nnew performance criteria and targets as well as the target \\r\\nbonuses \\r\\nfor the Executive Board members\\' Performance Bonus plans for the year under \\r\\nreview. \\r\\nIn September and December 2013, \\r\\nit dealt with \\r\\nmatters \\r\\nrelating to\\r\\n Executive \\r\\nBoard compensation.\\r\\n I\\r\\nn February 2014\\r\\n, it discussed\\r\\n the termination agreement regarding \\r\\nthe Executive Board service contract concluded with \\r\\nErich\\r\\n Stamminger\\r\\n, as well \\r\\nas \\r\\nthe \\r\\nPerformance Bonuses to be granted to the members of the Executive Board for the year \\r\\nunder review. At each of these meetin\\r\\ngs, the committee resolved upon respective \\r\\nresolution prop\\r\\nosals to present to\\r\\n the Supervisory Board.\\r\\n  \\xc5\\x92 The \\r\\nAudit Committee \\r\\nheld five meetings in the year under review and also one meeting in \\r\\nFebruary 2014, dealing with topics of the year under review. The Chief Financial Officer \\r\\nand the auditor were present at all\\r\\n meetings and reported to the committee members \\r\\nin detail.\\r\\n  The focal point of the committee\\'s work in February 2013 was a preliminary examination \\r\\nof the annual financial statements and the consolidated financial statements for 2012, \\r\\nincluding the combined\\r\\n management report of adidas AG and the Group, as well as the \\r\\nExecutive Board\\'s proposal regarding the appropriation of retained earnings. Following \\r\\n\\r\\nan in\\r\\n-depth review of the audit reports with the auditor, \\r\\nat its meeting in March \\r\\nthe Audit \\r\\nCommittee recom\\r\\nmended that the Supervisory Board approve the annual financial \\r\\nstatements and the consolidated financial statements. In addition, after obtaining the \\r\\nauditor\\'s declaration of independence, the Audit Committee prepared the Supervisory \\r\\nBoard\\'s proposal to th\\r\\ne Annual General Meeting concerning the selection of the auditor of \\r\\nthe annual financial statements and the consolidated financial statements for 2013\\r\\n. After \\r\\njointly\\r\\n establishing\\r\\n the priority topics for the audit, the committee discussed in detail the \\r\\ngran\\r\\nting of the corresponding audit assignments. It \\r\\nthen \\r\\ndealt \\r\\nin November \\r\\nwith the audit \\r\\nfee arrangements and monitored the auditor\\'s independence and qualifications by \\r\\n\\r\\nobtaining information on the measures taken by the auditor to guarantee independence \\r\\nand q\\r\\nualification\\r\\ns, and assured itself that the auditor does not face any conflicts of \\r\\ninterest.\\r\\n Furt\\r\\nhermore, the \\r\\nExecutive Board provided the Audit C\\r\\nommittee with\\r\\n information regarding \\r\\ntax and \\r\\ncustoms strategies and \\r\\nthe potential \\r\\nrisks\\r\\n in these areas\\r\\n. The members of the Audit Committee examined in detail the quarterly financial reports \\r\\n\\r\\nand the first half year report, together with the Chief Financial Officer and the auditor, \\r\\nprior to their publication. \\r\\n  At \\r\\na c\\r\\nommittee meeting\\r\\n in September\\r\\n, the committe\\r\\ne members focused solely on the \\r\\ntopic of risk management and the internal control system as well as the compliance \\r\\n\\r\\nmanagement \\r\\nsystem. In this context, the committee members dealt in particular with the \\r\\nmain risk factors for the Group and the related control measures as well as the further \\r\\n\\r\\nexpansion of the compliance organisation and compliance management. The committee \\r\\nmembers critically analysed the audit results of the Internal Audit function and approved \\r\\nthe audit plan for 2013/2014. As part of their exa\\r\\nmination of the effectiveness of the \\r\\ninternal control system and the internal audit system, the committee members reviewed \\r\\n\\r\\nin depth the applied methods and systems and the effectiveness thereof with the aid of \\r\\nwritten and oral reports. In the course of the\\r\\n following \\r\\ncomprehensive\\r\\n discussions, inter \\r\\nalia with the auditor, they assured themselves of the effectiveness of the systems.\\r\\n  In the context of the regular reporting of the Chief Compliance Officer on material \\r\\n\\r\\ncompliance issues, the committee dealt intensively with the compliance case that had \\r\\narisen at Reebok India Company and the consequences thereof.\\r\\n  \\xc5\\x92 The \\r\\nMediation Committee\\r\\n, established in accordance with the German Co\\r\\n-Determination \\r\\nAct (Mitbestimmungsgesetz \\r\\n\\xc5\\x92 MitbestG), had no reason to convene in 2013. \\r\\n  \\xc5\\x92 The \\r\\nNomination Committee\\r\\n held one meeting in the year under review. The focal point of \\r\\nthis meeting was the preparations\\r\\n for the next election of shareholder representatives on \\r\\nthe Supervisory Board by the Annual General Meeting on May 8, 2014.\\r\\n  \\r\\n\\xc5\\x92 Ad hoc committees:\\r\\n The ad hoc \\xef\\xac\\x81Committee for Real Estate Projects\\xef\\xac\\x82, which was established in 2009, and the \\r\\nad hoc \\xef\\xac\\x81Convertible Bond/Bond with Warrants\\xef\\xac\\x82 committee did not meet in the year under \\r\\nreview.\\r\\n  Examination of the adidas AG 2013 annual financial statements and consolidated \\r\\nfinancial\\r\\n statements \\r\\nKPMG audited the 2013 consolidated financial statements prepared by the Executive Board \\r\\nin accordance with \\xc2\\xa7 315a German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch \\r\\n\\xc5\\x92 HGB) in \\r\\ncompliance with IFRS and issued an unqualified opinion thereon. The auditor also approved \\r\\n\\r\\nwithout qualification the 2013 annual financial statements of adidas AG, prepared in \\r\\naccordance with HGB requirements, as well as the combined management report for adidas \\r\\nAG and the Group. The financial statements, the proposal put forward by the Executiv\\r\\ne Board regarding the appropriation of retained earnings and the auditor\\xe2\\x84\\xa2s reports were \\r\\n\\r\\ndistributed by the Executive Board to all Supervisory Board members in a timely manner. \\r\\nWe examined the documents in depth, with a particular focus on legality and regu\\r\\nlarity, in \\r\\nthe presence of the auditor at the Audit Committee meeting held on February 28, 2014 and \\r\\nat the Supervisory Board\\xe2\\x84\\xa2s March\\r\\n 4, 2014 financial statements meeting, during which the \\r\\nExecutive Board explained the financial statements in detail\\r\\n. The Ex\\r\\necutive Board\\xe2\\x84\\xa2s \\r\\ncommentaries concerning the goodwill impairment necessary for the 2013 financial year\\r\\n were also a topic at these meetings\\r\\n. \\r\\nAt both\\r\\n meetings, the auditor reported the material \\r\\nresults of the audit with a focus on the priority topics of the year under review as agreed with \\r\\n\\r\\nthe Audit Committee and was available for questions and the provision of additional \\r\\ninformation. The auditor did not report any significant weaknesses with respect to the \\r\\ninternal control and risk management system relating to the accounting process. We also \\r\\ndiscussed in depth with the Executive Board the proposal concerning the appropriation of \\r\\nretained earnings, which provides for a dividend \\r\\nof \\r\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 1.5\\r\\n0 \\r\\nper dividend\\r\\n-entitled share and \\r\\nadopted it in light of the Group\\xe2\\x84\\xa2s good f\\r\\ninancial situation and future prospects as well as the \\r\\n\\r\\nexpectations of our shareholders. Based on our own examinations of the annual and \\r\\nconsolidated financial statements, we are convinced that there are no objections to be \\r\\nraised. At our financial statements meeting, therefore, following the recommendation of the \\r\\nAudit Committee, we approved the audit results and the financial statements prepared by \\r\\nthe Executive Board. The annual financial statements of adidas AG were thus approved.\\r\\n  Expression of thanks\\r\\n On behalf of the adidas Group, we wish to thank \\r\\nErich\\r\\n Stamminger for his leadership and his \\r\\nexpertise as well as for his countless contributions to the success of the Group and its \\r\\nbrands over the last three decades.\\r\\n  \\r\\nFurthermore, o\\r\\nn behalf of the Supervisory Board, I wish to thank the Executive Board and all \\r\\nadidas Group employees around the world for their tremendous personal dedication, their \\r\\nperformance and their ongoing commitment, and I also thank the employee representatives \\r\\nfor their good co\\r\\nllaboration.\\r\\n  \\r\\nFor the Supervisory Board\\r\\n IGOR LANDAU\\r\\n Chairman of the Supervisory Board\\r\\n March 2014\\r\\n adidas AG Adi-Dassler-Str. 1 91074 Herzogenaurach Germany www.adidas-Group.com\\r\\n'}"
