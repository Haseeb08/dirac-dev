The names and domiciles of other companies in which adidas AG (\"Company\") holds at least a one-fifth interest, either directly or indirectly, and the disclosures related to these companies can be found in Appendix 3 to these notes. Accounting policies Acquired intangible fixed assets are recognized at cost and subject to periodic straight-line amortization over their expected useful lives. Tangible fixed assets are recognized at (acquisition or production) cost. All recognizable direct and overhead costs are included in production costs. Items with a finite life are depreciated/amortized over their expected useful lives. Buildings are subject to straight-line amortization at adidas AG. The estimated useful life of business premises is 50 years maximum and from two to ten years for technical equipment and machinery, other equipment, and operating and office equipment. The refurbishment costs of buildings comprising the World of Sports headquarters, owned by GEV Grundst\\xc3\\xbccksgesellschaft Herzogenaurach mbH & Co. KG, a company within the adidas AG Group, are depreciated over 20 years. The buildings located on the \"World of Sports\" grounds, which are beneficially owned by adidas AG by virtue of a use agreement between the property owner GEV Grundst\\xc3\\xbccksgesellschaft Herzogenaurach mbH & Co. KG and adidas AG are depreciated over a useful life of 33 years. Chattel assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis. Minor-value assets worth less than EUR 410 are written off in full in the year of their acquisition. Write-downs to the lower fair value are also recognized if an impairment is anticipated to be other than temporary. Long-term financial assets are recognized at cost. To the extent necessary, write-downs are made to their lower fair value. If the reasons for the write-down no longer apply, the write- down is reversed to no higher than the historical cost of the asset. Inventories are measured at the lower of cost or market. Manufacturing costs comprise direct costs that must be capitalized and appropriate portions of overhead costs. Allowances are taken for discernible fashion and technical risks, age structure, and marketability. Receivables and other assets are generally recognized at nominal values. Individual adjustments and allowances for doubtful accounts are taken to cover discernible risks. Derivative financial transactions entered into with banks by Group Treasury (primarily forward currency and currency option transactions) are generally related to underlying transactions with Group companies. Hedge accounting is applied if there is a direct hedging relationship between these transactions. The net hedge presentation method is applied. The fair values of the hedges are matched and changes in value from the hedged risk which offset each other are not recognized. Unrealized losses are recognized in profit or loss only if they are not covered by unrealized gains in the hedge accounting. Derivative transactions that are not recognized using hedge accounting are measured individually at fair value. Any losses resulting from these transactions are recognized in profit or loss; gains are not recognized in excess of cost. Deferred taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the carrying amounts and tax bases for assets, liabilities, prepaid expenses and deferred income. Deferred taxes are calculated based on the combined income tax rate of adidas AG, which is currently 28 %. The combined income tax rate comprises corporate income tax, municipal trade tax and the solidarity surcharge. A net tax burden would be recognized on the balance sheet as a deferred tax liability. There is an option to recognize a deferred tax asset under \\xc2\\xa7 274 (1) no. 2 HGB in the event of any overall tax benefit granted. In the fiscal year, the Company had a net deferred tax asset, which it did not recognize on its balance sheet. Subscribed capital is recognized at the nominal amount. The Company exercised its option to maintain the special tax-allowable reserve as permitted upon the first-time adoption of the German Accounting Law Modernization Act (Bilanzrechtsmodernisierungsgesetz , \"BilMoG\"). Accounting policies relating to this reserve and its reversal remain the same as previously. Provisions for pensions are calculated on the basis of actuarial biometric assumptions (2005 G mortality tables by Prof. Dr. Klaus Heubeck) in accordance with the projected unit credit method (PUC). The provision amount recognized under the PUC method is defined as the actuarial present value of the pension obligations earned by the employees by the balance sheet date according to the retirement benefit formula and the vested pension amount based on their service in the past. Expected future wage and pension benefit increases are factored in to the provision using a 1% to 2% p.a. growth rate. Fluctuation is assumed to range between 5% and 20%, depending on age. The rate used to discount the pension obligations in accordance with \\xc2\\xa7 253 (2) sentence 2 HGB amounts to 4.90% as of December 31, 2013 (previous year: 5.06%); this rate was determined and published by the German Bundesbank as the average market rate for the past seven fiscal years for an assumed term of 15 years. Other provisions cover all discernible risks and uncertain obligations and are recognized in the settlement amount dictated by prudent business judgment in order to cover future payment obligations. Future price and cost increases are factored in to the extent that there is sufficient objective evidence that they will occur. Provisions with terms in excess of one year are discounted at the average market rate for their respective maturity over the past seven years, in accordance with \\xc2\\xa7 253 (2) sentence 1 HGB . Provisions for partial and early retirement liabilities, reported under other provisions, are discounted at 3.65% as of December 31, 2013 (previous year: 3.98%). This rate was determined and published by the German Bundesbank as the average market rate for the past seven fiscal years for a residual term of 3 years. Securities classified as current assets serve exclusively to satisfy liabilities from partial and early retirement obligations and are isolated from all other creditors. In accordance with the provisions of HGB, these assets must be offset against the liabilities for which they serve as hedges. Analogously to the offsetting of assets against liabilities, the associated income from securities is offset against interest expenses. The assets to be offset are measured at fair value as determined by their current exchange or market price. Any difference arising between the fair value and historical cost of the assets to be offset is subject to a restriction on distribution. The effect from the annual adjustment of the discount rate applied to the provisions in accordance with \\xc2\\xa7 253 (2) HGB is recognized immediately in profit and loss under other interest and similar income or interest and similar expenses. Internally generated intangible assets are not capitalized. Liabilities are recognized at their settlement amount. Revenues are recognized once the price risk has been transferred to the purchaser. This generally occurs upon delivery of the merchandise. Licensing revenues are recognized in accordance with the underlying contractual agreements. Claims and revenues generally arise whenever the licensee generates sales revenue with adidas products. Assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are recorded at the mean spot rate as of the respective transaction date. Currency translation losses arising as of the balance sheet date due to the measurement of foreign-denominated assets and liabilities are reported. Currency translation gains from the measurement of current assets and liabilities falling due within less than one year are recorded in profit or loss in accordance with \\xc2\\xa7 256a HGB . Currency translation gains are reported under \"other operating income\" and currency translation losses are reported under \"other operating expenses\". Income from profit and loss transfer agreements is recognized if the amount to be transferred or absorbed can be determined with reasonable certainty, even if the annual financial statements of the subsidiary have not yet been adopted. Income from long-term equity investments is generally recognized during the period in which a claim to such income arises and it can be reasonably expected that the amounts due will be collected. 1.

The following discussion of the existing authorized capital does not extend to include the revocation of Authorized Capital 2009/I, 2010 and 2011 resolved by the Annual General Meeting on May 8, 2013, which also was not utilized up to May 8, 2013. Pursuant to Article 4 paragraphs 2, 3, and 4 of the Articles of Association which, as of the balance sheet date governs the Company\\'s authorized capital, the Executive Board is entitled, subject to Supervisory Board approval, to increase the share capital: until June 30, 2018 by issuing new shares against cash contributions, once or severally, by up to a maximum of EUR 50,000,000 and, subject to Supervisory Board approval, to exclude fractional shares from shareholders\\' subscription rights (Authorized Capital 2013/I); until June 30, 2016 by issuing new shares against contributions in kind, once or severally, up to a maximum of EUR 25,000,000 and, subject to Supervisory Board approval, to exclude shareholders\\' subscription rights (Authorized Capital 2013/II); until June 30, 2018 by issuing new shares against cash contributions, once or severally, by up to a maximum of EUR 20,000,000 and, subject to Supervisory Board approval, to exclude shareholders\\' subscription rights for fractional amounts and when issuing the new shares at an issue price that is not substantially below the market price of shares of the same class; subscription rights may also be excluded in connection with the listing of the Company\\'s shares on a foreign stock exchange (Authorized Capital 2013/III).

The conditional capital increase will only be implemented to the extent that the holders/creditors of warrants and conversion rights and/or the persons obligated to exercise the warrant or conversion feature from bonds with warrants or convertible bonds issued or guaranteed by the Company or a subordinate Group company prior to May 5, 2015 pursuant to the authorization of the Executive Board by shareholder resolution dated May 6, 2010 exercise their warrant or conversion rights or, if they are obligated to exercise the warrant or conversion feature, fulfill their obligation to exercise the warrant or conversion feature or, if the Company avails itself an option to substitute payment of the monetary amount falling due, in part or in whole, by delivering shares in the Company, to the extent no cash settlement is granted, or own shares or the shares of another listed company may be used to service the obligation. The new shares will be issued at the relevant warrant or conversion price to be determined in accordance with the aforementioned authorization resolution. The new shares carry dividend rights from the beginning of the fiscal year in which they are created. The Executive Board is authorized, subject to Supervisory Board approval, to stipulate the further details concerning the implementation of the conditional capital increase. The Executive Board of adidas AG has not issued any shares from Contingent Capital 2010 in the 2013 fiscal year or after the balance sheet date up until February 14, 2014.

The conversion right may be exercised at any time in the period from May 21, 2012 to June 5, 2019 and (subject to any modification of the conversion ratio as a result of the anti-dilution protections set forth under \\xc2\\xa7 10 of the bond terms or a change of control pursuant to \\xc2\\xa7 13 of the bond terms) converted into 6,016,954 shares in the Company, subject to the expiration of the conversion right stipulated in \\xc2\\xa7 6 section 3 of the bond terms and conditions or of the exclusion period stipulated in \\xc2\\xa7 6 section 4.

The provisions for former members of the Executive Board and their survivors amounted to EUR 36,545 thousand as of December 31, 2013 (previous year: EUR 36,839 thousand). Additionally, there are EUR 6,099 thousand in indirect obligations (previous year: EUR 6,193 thousand) for which no provisions have been recognized, since these obligations are fully funded by the pension fund. As of the balance sheet date, there are no shortfalls for the indirect obligations. Former members of the Executive Board and their survivors received a total of EUR 3,421 thousand in retirement pay in fiscal year 2013 (previous year: EUR 3,336 thousand). The largest item in other provisions concerns provisions for personnel of EUR 90, 799 thousand (previous year: EUR 87,716 thousand). This amount is primarily attributable to provisions for performance-based remuneration components. Additional significant items in other provisions are provisions for outstanding invoices at EUR 44,542 thousand (previous year: EUR 41,427 thousand) and provisions for marketing of EUR 41,463 thousand (previous year: EUR 34,226 thousand).

The liabilities to affiliated companies primarily concern liabilities from Group Treasury activities. Trade payables to affiliated companies amounted to EUR 14,357 thousand (previous year: EUR 10,048 thousand). Other liabilities include leasing liabilities, tax and customs liabilities, liabilities relating to social security and similar obligations, accrued interest not yet payable, credit balances in accounts receivable, and salaries and commissions payable. The convertible bond issue in the amount of EUR 500,000 thousand becomes due in 2019 and is divided into 2,500 bearer bonds with equal rights, each in the nominal amount of EUR 200 thousand. The bondholder has the right to convert each bond in full, but not partially, into registered common shares (no-par-value shares) during an exercise period. There is also the right to early settlement in 2017 in compliance with a notice period, which may not be exercised if adidas AG has exercised the right to early settlement. 13. Contingent liabilities and other financial commitments Contingent liabilities EUR thousand Dec. 31, 2013 Dec. 31, 2012 Warranty obligations 1,376,875 1,563,712 of which for affiliated companies - Bank loans 608,767 708,152 - Letters of credit 23,465 20,560 - Guarantee Agreement 744,643 835,000 The guarantee obligations for bank loans to affiliated companies are from lines of credit drawn on by affiliated companies. adidas AG\\'s letters of credit are mainly import letters of credit in connection with product purchases in the Far East. The guarantee agreements are with adidas International Finance B.V., Amsterdam, the Netherlands, and secure a third- party loan. Due to past experience and the adidas Group\\'s current strong financial position, the risk that these will be called on is considered extremely slight. Other financial commitments Other financial commitments of EUR 678,040 thousand (previous year: EUR 716.977 thousand) for adidas AG include amounts for the entire foreseeable contractual period for promotion, advertising, rental and leasing agreements as of December 31, 2013. This includes commitments of EUR 29,257 thousand (previous year: EUR 33,629 thousand) to GEV Grundst\\xc3\\xbccksgesellschaft Herzogenaurach mbH und Co. KG, a wholly-owned subsidiary. Maturities EUR thousand in 2013 224,901 2014-2017 357,363 after 2017 54,880 637,144 The Group acquires approximately 80% of its products in Asia. Since a major portion of the product costs concerns raw materials that the suppliers have to acquire in US dollars (USD), billings to the adidas Group are also made in USD. In contrast, sales by Group companies to customers are mainly in euros (EUR), pounds Sterling (GBP), Japanese yen (JPY), and in many other currencies. Currency hedges are entered into to reduce the risk of changes in fair value and in cash flows (currency risks). Most subsidiaries hedge their currency risks through adidas AG, except for those subsidiaries that are unable to hedge through adidas AG due to local currency restrictions, or for whom it is more sensible to hedge locally for economic reasons. Currency risks that are assumed by adidas AG from subsidiaries by entering into inter-Group currency transactions are strategically hedged with banks, normally for a period of between 12 and 24 months, using forward exchange transactions, currency swaps, currency options, or a combination of currency options, which provide protection and, at the same time, the opportunity to profit from future beneficial foreign exchange rate movements on financial markets. In 2013, the adidas Group purchased about USD 2.6 billion net to hedge its operating business.

The fair values (gains and losses) of the currency hedging contracts are presented as gross values. Currency options are measured using market quotes or option pricing models (Garman- Kohlhagen model). The notional amounts of outstanding financial derivatives in foreign currency are translated into euros at year-end closing rates. The carrying values are taken from the balance sheet.

The maintenance of the books and records and the preparation of the annual financial statements and management report in accordance with German commercial law are the responsibility of the Company\\xe2\\x84\\xa2s Executive Board. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the annual financial statements, together with the bookkeeping system, and the management report based on our audit. We conducted our audit of the annual financial statements in accordance with \\xc2\\xa7 317 HGB and German generally accepted standards for the audit of financial statements promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftspr\\xc3\\xbcfer (Institute of Public Auditors in Germany, \\xe2\\x80\\x94IDW\\xef\\xac\\x82). Those standards require that we plan and p erform the audit such that misstatements materially affecting the presentation of the assets and liabilities, financial position and profit or loss in the annual financial statements in accordance with German principles of proper accounting and in the management report are detected with reasonable assurance. Knowledge of the business activities and the economic and legal environment of the Company and evaluations of possible misstatements are taken into account in the determination of audit procedures. The effectiveness of the accounting -related internal control system and the evidence supporting the disclosures in the books and records, the annual financial statements and the management report are examined primarily on a test basis within the framework of t he audit. The audit includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by the Executive Board, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the annual financial statements and management report. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our audit has not led to any reservations. In our opinion, based on the findings of our audit, the annual financial statements comply with the statutory regulations and give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position, and profit or loss of adidas AG in accordance with German principles of proper accounting. The management report is consistent with the annual financial statements, and on the whole, provides a suitable understanding of th e Company\\xe2\\x84\\xa2s position and suitably presents the risks and opportunities of future development. Munich, February 14, 2014 KPMG AG Wirtschaftspr\\xc3\\xbcfungsgesellschaft [original German version signed by:] Braun Wirtschaftspr\\xc3\\xbcfer [German Public Auditor] Wolper Wirtschaftspr\\xc3\\xbcfer [German Public Auditor] Responsibility Statement To the best of our knowledge, and in accordance with the applicable reporting principles, the annual financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the company, and the Management Report, which has been combined with the Group Management Report, includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the company, together with a description of the material opportunities and risks associated with the expected development of the company. Herzogenaurach, February 14, 20 14 The Executive Board Supervisory Board Report IGOR LANDAU Chairman of the Supervisory Board Dear Shareholders, We look back on 2013 as a challenging but also successful year. Thanks to strong brands and partnerships in the world of sport s, a s well as first -class innovations, the adidas Group was again able to achieve good overall business results. Growth in the emerging markets as well as the strong gross margin improve ment were key highlights . However, t he Group also faced significant headwinds in 2013 . The significant negative currency translation effects , a weak development in Western Europe , generally lower demand in the golf market as well as distribution issues in Russia/CIS were particular challenges. Nevertheless, these issues have been proactively and resolutely managed, and the Group is well positioned to again achieve sales growth at all brands, in all regions and in all markets as well as to improve profitability in 2014. Supervision and advice in dialogue with the Executive Board In the year under review, we again performed all our tasks laid down by law, the Articles of Association and the Rules of Procedure carefully and conscientiously. We regularly advised the Executive Board on th e management of the company and diligently and continuously supervised its management activities, assuring ourselves of the legality, expediency and regularity thereof. The Executive Board involved us directly in all of the Group\\xe2\\x84\\xa2s fundamental decisions. After in-depth consultation and examination of the detailed information submitted to us by the Executive Board, we approved individual transactions where required by law. The Executive Board informed us extensively and in a timely manner through written a nd oral reports at our Supervisory Board meetings. This information covered all relevant aspects of the Group\\xe2\\x84\\xa2s business strategy and business planning, including finance, investment and personnel planning, the course of business and the Group\\xe2\\x84\\xa2s financial position and profitability. We were also kept up to date on matters relating to the risk situation, risk management and compliance as well as all major decisions and business transactions. The Executive Board explained immediately and in a detailed manner any deviations in business performance from the established plans, and we discussed these matters in depth within the Supervisory Board. The Executive Board regularly provided us with detailed reports for the preparation of our meetings. We thus always ha d the opportunity to critically analyse the Executive Board\\'s reports and resolution proposals within the committees and within the Supervisory Board as a whole and to put forward any suggestions we might have before resolving upon the Executive Board\\xe2\\x84\\xa2s proposals after in -depth examination and consultation. In the periods between our meetings, the Executive Board kept us continuously informed about the current business situation by means of monthly reports. In addition to five regular meetings of the Supervisory Board, we held two extraordinary meetings in the year under review . In January 2014, an extraordinary Supervisory Board meeting relating to Executive Board matters took place by way of a conferenc e ca ll. Two of the shareholder representatives were unable to participate in person due to the short notice. The regular meeting of the entire Supervisory Board which took place in February 2014 dealt with matters relating to the 2013 financial year. Apart f rom one regular meeting, which two members were prevented from attending due to other business appointments that could not be postponed, all Supervisory Board members attended all regular meetings in the year under review. The average attendance rate at meetings of the entire Supervisory Board was therefore just under 97%. All the committee meetings, with the exception of one meeting of the Audit Committee and of the General Committee, were fully attended. The external auditor, KPMG AG Wirtschaftspr\\xc3\\xbcfungsge sellschaft (KPMG), attended all regular meetings of the Supervisory Board, inasfar as they did not deal with Executive Board matters. KPMG also attended all meetings of the Audit Committee. The employee representatives held separate meetings to prepare and discuss agenda items for the meetings of the entire Supervisory Board. In the periods between meetings, the Supervisory Board Chairman and the Audit Committee Chairman maintained regular contact with the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Of ficer with respect to matters such as corporate strategy, business development and planning, the risk situation and risk management as well as compliance. In addition, the Supervisory Board Chairman was immediately informed about any significant events of fundamental importance for evaluating the situation and development of the company and management activities. Topics for the entire Supervisory Board Our consultations and examinations focused on the following topics: Situation and business development The development of sales and earnings, the employment situation as well as the financial position of the Group and the business development of the Group\\xe2\\x84\\xa2s segments and individual regions were presented to us in detail by the Executive Board following the close of the respective quarter and were discussed regularly. Further ongoing topics for discussion were the possible impact of global economic developments and negative currency translation effects as well as the development of individual br ands. In March 2013, we reviewed and dealt intensively with the KPMG -certified 2012 annual financial statements and consolidated financial statements, including the combined management report for adidas AG and the Group, as well as the Executive Board\\'s proposal regarding the appropriation of retained earnings. In May, the Executive Board reported to us in detail about the measures initiated in connection with clearing up the compliance case that had arisen at Reebok India Company. In addition, the Executive Board provided us with information on business development and planned marke ting activities in the football category in the run -up to the 2014 World Cup . In August, we dealt intensively with the Group\\'s new logistics and warehousing strategy and the possible financial consequences . At our extraordinary meeting in September, the Ex ecutive Board informed us that, due to recent negative market developments, the published sales and earnings targets for the year under review were no longer achievable. We discussed the reasons in detail, including the recent intensification of negative currency effects, the continued softness in the global golf market and the unexpected short -term distribution constraint s as a result of the transition to a new distribution facility in Russia. In November, we were provided with detailed information about the competition situation in the sporting goods market. Transactions requiring Supervisory Board approval In accordance with statutory regulations and the Rules of Procedure of the Supervisory Board, certain transactions and measures require a formal resol ution or the prior approval of the Supervisory Board. In the context of this requirement, at our meeting in February , we discussed in detail and approved the budget and investment planning for 2013 presented by the Executive Board, which, in view of the macroeconomic environment, we deemed to be ambitious. Additionally, following completion of the project, we approved the dissolution of the \"Apple\" committee, which had been established ad hoc related to the acquisition of Adams Golf, Inc., USA in 2012. At our meeting in March, we discussed and resolved upon the resolutions to be proposed to the 2013 Annual General Meeting, including the proposal regarding the appropriation of retained earnings for the 20 12 financial year. At an extraordinary meeting in June, held by way of a conference call, the Executive Board provided us with detailed information on key strategic distribution centres leased by Group companies on a long -term basis and the possible purcha se thereof in the interest of optimising profitability . W e specifically dealt with the Executive Board\\'s proposal to purchase the strategic ally important distribution centre in Manchester, UK, hitherto leased by a Group company . At our August meeting, foll owing the Executive Board\\xe2\\x84\\xa2s detailed presentation on the future logistics and warehousing strategy for the adidas Group, we resolved to invest in the distribution centre in Brazil. Additionally, we dealt with the various possibilities for funding pension obligations of adidas AG and approved funding in the form of a pension trust fund. Composition of the Executive Board In the year under review and at the beginning of 2014, we took important dec isions concerning changes on the Executive Board. At our meeting in May 2013, we resolved to extend Erich Stamminger\\'s Executive Board mandate by a further three years, taking due account of his excellent performance and successes in Global Brands . Furthermore, after extensive consultation, we approved the changes in the terms of his Executive Board service contract, following the General Committee\\'s proposal. At our Supervisory Board meeting in September, held by way of a conference call, we extensi vely discussed and resolved upon the appointment of Roland Auschel to the Executive Board with responsibility for Global Sales, effective October 1, 2013, and we established his compensation, following the General Committee\\'s proposal . Roland Auschel has h eld various management positions with in the Group in Germany and abroad in the past 20 years. With the creation of a separate Executive Board function for Global Sale s, we have taken into account the importance of Global Sales for our company. At our extraordinary meeting on January 8, 2014, after due consideration within the Supervisory Board as a whole, we complied with the request of our long -standing Executive Board member Erich Stamminger to release him from his duties as Executive Board member effective March 5, 2014. We approved the termination of his appointment by mutual consent and, following in -depth consultation, resolved upon the appointment of Eric Liedtke as member of the Executive Board with responsibility for Global Brands. Eric Liedtke has held various management positions within the adidas Group both in and outside Germany in the past 20 years. At the same time, we determined his compensation and approved the termination agreement regarding the Executive Board service contract with Erich Stamminger, following the General Committee\\'s proposal. Executive Board compensation Key topics of our meeting as well as of our circular resolution in February 2013 were the determination of the Performance Bonuses to be granted to our Execut ive Board members for 2012 and the redetermination of the already paid Performance Bonuses for the 2011 financial year and the previous years, as proposed by the General Committee . This reassessment was necessary as the financial figures relevant for determining the degree of target achievement of our Executive Board members in 2011 and prior years had to be adjusted as a result of the financial irregularities that had arisen at Reebok India Company, which had also led to a restatement of the consolidated financial statements for 2011 and prior years. While the restatement of the financial figures necessitated redetermination of the Performance Bonuses for the 2011 financial year and prior years, resulting in obligations for repayment by the Executive Board, the already paid LTIP Bonuses 2009/2011 were not affected. In March 2013, following in -depth consideration , we resolved upon the key performance criteria for granting the 2013 Performance Bonuses, together with the individual short -term targets, an d determined the Performance Bonus target amount relevant for each Executive Board member as proposed by the General Committee . In February 2014, we discussed the performance of the Executive Board members in the year under review and resolved upon the Per formance Bonuses to be granted to them. Further information on compensation for the 2013 financial year can be found in the Compensation Report SEE COMPENSATION REP ORT, P. 53. Corporate governance The Supervisory Board regularly monitors the application and further development of the corporate governance regulations within the company, in particular the implementation of the recommendations of the German Corporate Governance Code (the \\xef\\xac\\x81Code\\xef\\xac\\x82). In ad dition to our February meetings, at which corporate governance is usually the focal point, we dealt in our August meeting with the amendments to the Code that were adopted by the Government Commission on the German Corporate Governance Code on May 1 3, 201 3, essentially concerning the subject \\xef\\xac\\x81Executive Board compensation\\xef\\xac\\x82. At this meeting, as well as at our meeting in February 2014, we extensively discussed the recommendation to introduce caps for the variable compensation components and resolved upon caps accordingly. At the February meeting, we also dealt extensively with the Code\\xe2\\x84\\xa2s recommendation that , when determining Executive Board compensation , consideration should be given to the relation between Executive Board compensation and that of top -level management and of employees overall including development of the compensation over time. We discussed in detail how to define the respective benchmark groups for the purpose of these comparisons , and then passed a resolution accordingly. At this meeting, after comprehensive discussion, we also resolved upon the 201 4 Declaration of Compliance. The Declaration of Compliance w as made permanently available to shareholders on the corporate website at: WWW.ADIDAS -GROUP.COM/CORPORATE_ GOVERNANCE . There was no indication of any conflicts of interest on the part of the members of the Executive and Supervisory Boards which would require immediate disclosure to the Supervisory Board and would also require reporting to the Annual General Meeting. There are no direct advisory or other service relationships between the company and a member of the Supervisory Board. Further information on corporate governance at the adidas Group can be found in the Corporate Governance Report including the Declaration on Corporate Governance SEE CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT INCLUDING THE DECLARATION ON CORPO RATE GOVERNANCE, P. 48. Efficient committee work In order to perform our tasks in an efficient manner, we have five Supervisory Board standing committees SEE SUPERVISORY BOAR D, P. 40 and also two project -related ad hoc committees, which were established in 2009 and 2012. These committees prepare resolutions of the Supervisory Board as well as topics for Supervisory Board meetings. In appropriate cases, and within the legally permissible framework, we have delegated the Supervisory Board\\xe2\\x84\\xa2s authority to pass resolutions to individual committees. With the exception of the Audit Committee, the Supervisory Board Chairman also chairs all the standing committees. The committee chairpersons inform the Supervisory Board about the content and results of the committee meetings at the subsequent meeting of the entire Supervisory Board. - The Steering Committee did not meet in the year under review. \\xc5\\x92 The General Committee held six meetings in 2013, two of them by way of a conference call. An additional meeting, dealing with topics relating to the year under review, took place in February 2014. The main focus of the meetings of the General Committee was the preparation of the resolutions of the Supervisory Board as a whole relating to the Executive Board members\\' compensation as explained in detail above \\xc5\\x92 in particular with regard to the concret e assessment of the Executive Board members\\' variable compensation \\xc5\\x92 as well as resolutions relating to personnel changes on the Executive Board. At its meeting in February 2013, the General Committee thoroughly discussed a resolution proposal for the Supervisory Board concerning the amount of the Performance Bonuses to be repaid by the Executive Board members for the 2011 financial year and previous years . It also assessed the individual degree of target achievement with respect to the Performance Bonuses to be paid to the Executive Board members for the 2012 financial year and resolved upon a corresponding recommendation to the Supervisory Board . Additionally , in March it discussed the new performance criteria and targets as well as the target bonuses for the Executive Board members\\' Performance Bonus plans for the year under review. In September and December 2013, it dealt with matters relating to Executive Board compensation. I n February 2014 , it discussed the termination agreement regarding the Executive Board service contract concluded with Erich Stamminger , as well as the Performance Bonuses to be granted to the members of the Executive Board for the year under review. At each of these meetin gs, the committee resolved upon respective resolution prop osals to present to the Supervisory Board. \\xc5\\x92 The Audit Committee held five meetings in the year under review and also one meeting in February 2014, dealing with topics of the year under review. The Chief Financial Officer and the auditor were present at all meetings and reported to the committee members in detail. The focal point of the committee\\'s work in February 2013 was a preliminary examination of the annual financial statements and the consolidated financial statements for 2012, including the combined management report of adidas AG and the Group, as well as the Executive Board\\'s proposal regarding the appropriation of retained earnings. Following an in -depth review of the audit reports with the auditor, at its meeting in March the Audit Committee recom mended that the Supervisory Board approve the annual financial statements and the consolidated financial statements. In addition, after obtaining the auditor\\'s declaration of independence, the Audit Committee prepared the Supervisory Board\\'s proposal to th e Annual General Meeting concerning the selection of the auditor of the annual financial statements and the consolidated financial statements for 2013 . After jointly establishing the priority topics for the audit, the committee discussed in detail the gran ting of the corresponding audit assignments. It then dealt in November with the audit fee arrangements and monitored the auditor\\'s independence and qualifications by obtaining information on the measures taken by the auditor to guarantee independence and q ualification s, and assured itself that the auditor does not face any conflicts of interest. Furt hermore, the Executive Board provided the Audit C ommittee with information regarding tax and customs strategies and the potential risks in these areas . The members of the Audit Committee examined in detail the quarterly financial reports and the first half year report, together with the Chief Financial Officer and the auditor, prior to their publication. At a c ommittee meeting in September , the committe e members focused solely on the topic of risk management and the internal control system as well as the compliance management system. In this context, the committee members dealt in particular with the main risk factors for the Group and the related control measures as well as the further expansion of the compliance organisation and compliance management. The committee members critically analysed the audit results of the Internal Audit function and approved the audit plan for 2013/2014. As part of their exa mination of the effectiveness of the internal control system and the internal audit system, the committee members reviewed in depth the applied methods and systems and the effectiveness thereof with the aid of written and oral reports. In the course of the following comprehensive discussions, inter alia with the auditor, they assured themselves of the effectiveness of the systems. In the context of the regular reporting of the Chief Compliance Officer on material compliance issues, the committee dealt intensively with the compliance case that had arisen at Reebok India Company and the consequences thereof. \\xc5\\x92 The Mediation Committee , established in accordance with the German Co -Determination Act (Mitbestimmungsgesetz \\xc5\\x92 MitbestG), had no reason to convene in 2013. \\xc5\\x92 The Nomination Committee held one meeting in the year under review. The focal point of this meeting was the preparations for the next election of shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board by the Annual General Meeting on May 8, 2014. \\xc5\\x92 Ad hoc committees: The ad hoc \\xef\\xac\\x81Committee for Real Estate Projects\\xef\\xac\\x82, which was established in 2009, and the ad hoc \\xef\\xac\\x81Convertible Bond/Bond with Warrants\\xef\\xac\\x82 committee did not meet in the year under review. Examination of the adidas AG 2013 annual financial statements and consolidated financial statements KPMG audited the 2013 consolidated financial statements prepared by the Executive Board in accordance with \\xc2\\xa7 315a German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch \\xc5\\x92 HGB) in compliance with IFRS and issued an unqualified opinion thereon. The auditor also approved without qualification the 2013 annual financial statements of adidas AG, prepared in accordance with HGB requirements, as well as the combined management report for adidas AG and the Group. The financial statements, the proposal put forward by the Executiv e Board regarding the appropriation of retained earnings and the auditor\\xe2\\x84\\xa2s reports were distributed by the Executive Board to all Supervisory Board members in a timely manner. We examined the documents in depth, with a particular focus on legality and regu larity, in the presence of the auditor at the Audit Committee meeting held on February 28, 2014 and at the Supervisory Board\\xe2\\x84\\xa2s March 4, 2014 financial statements meeting, during which the Executive Board explained the financial statements in detail . The Ex ecutive Board\\xe2\\x84\\xa2s commentaries concerning the goodwill impairment necessary for the 2013 financial year were also a topic at these meetings . At both meetings, the auditor reported the material results of the audit with a focus on the priority topics of the year under review as agreed with the Audit Committee and was available for questions and the provision of additional information. The auditor did not report any significant weaknesses with respect to the internal control and risk management system relating to the accounting process. We also discussed in depth with the Executive Board the proposal concerning the appropriation of retained earnings, which provides for a dividend of \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 1.5 0 per dividend -entitled share and adopted it in light of the Group\\xe2\\x84\\xa2s good f inancial situation and future prospects as well as the expectations of our shareholders. Based on our own examinations of the annual and consolidated financial statements, we are convinced that there are no objections to be raised. At our financial statements meeting, therefore, following the recommendation of the Audit Committee, we approved the audit results and the financial statements prepared by the Executive Board. The annual financial statements of adidas AG were thus approved. Expression of thanks On behalf of the adidas Group, we wish to thank Erich Stamminger for his leadership and his expertise as well as for his countless contributions to the success of the Group and its brands over the last three decades. Furthermore, o n behalf of the Supervisory Board, I wish to thank the Executive Board and all adidas Group employees around the world for their tremendous personal dedication, their performance and their ongoing commitment, and I also thank the employee representatives for their good co llaboration.
